# FindMyGroup
Group finding app for close distances

Android app to help people find their groups, made for Hack OHI/O, a hackathon at Ohio State University. The goal was to provide a compass to point to nearby group members, allowing them to find each other in crowded rooms.

The app is not finished and does not function properly.
